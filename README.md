# zirconsatH2O
Code to model zircon saturation as a function of melt H2O in the paper "A zircon case for super-wet arc magmas" by Nathwani et al. (2024) in Nature Communications.

This model implements `thermoengine` and must be run in the 	[ENKI environment](http://www.enki-portal.org/) or `thermoengine` must be downloaded and run locally.
